While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).\n\nI love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.\n\n### RECENT PROJECTS\n\n-   OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes it easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI, get it onto your WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.\n-   My Medium blog covers my ongoing attempts to instrument and automate everything in my house.\n\n","path":"/home","uploadedOn":"2020-05-22T04:26:49.184Z","_id":"vke98G7h75InxKQT"}
